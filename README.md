<h2 align="left">About me</h2>

###

<p align="left">I started my technical journey as a backend developer with PHP. Throughout my career, I have worked with various <br>languages and tools, including Power BI, Microsoft SQL, Ionic, Java, and WordPress. <br> <br>For the last six years, I have focused on the Flutter framework. I chose Flutter because of its capability to deliver <br>native-like performance and provide a consistent UI across multiple platforms. I worked on several high-profile <br>projects, including e-commerce, fitness, farm and education. These experiences have allowed me to build <br>applications that cater to different user needs while maintaining high performance and usability. <br> <br>Experienced in Agile/Scrum methodologies and the design of scalable architectures, with a focus on continuous <br>integration and delivery (CI/CD).</p>
